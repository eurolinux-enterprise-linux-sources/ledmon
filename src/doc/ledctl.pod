=head1 NAME

ledctl - Intel(R) LED control application for a storage enclosures.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ledctl> [I<OPTIONS>] I<pattern_name>=I<list_of_devices> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ledctl is user space application design to control LEDs associated with each
slot in an enclosure or a drive bay. There are two types of system: 2-LEDs
system (Activity LED, Status LED) and 3-LEDs system (Activity LED, Locate LED,
Fail LED). User must have root privileges to use this application.

The ledctl application uses SGPIO and SES-2 protocol to control LEDs.
The program implements IBPI patterns of SFF-8489 specification for SGPIO.
Please note some enclosures do not stick close to SFF-8489 specification.
It might happen that enclosure processor will accept an IBPI pattern but it will
blink the LEDs not according to SFF-8489 specification or it has limited number
of patterns supported.

LED management (AHCI) and S<SAF-TE> protocols are not supported.

The ledctl application has been verified to work with Intel(R) storage
controllers (i.e. Intel(R) AHCI controller). The application might work with
storage controllers of other vendors (especially SCSI/SAS
controllers). However storage controllers of other vendors have not been
tested.

The ledmon application has the highest priority when accessing LEDs then other
programs. It means some patterns set by ledctl may have no effect
(except Locate pattern).

The ledctl application is part of Intel(R) Enclosure LED Utilities.

=head2 Pattern Names

The ledctl application accepts the following names for I<pattern_name> argument
according to SFF-8489 specification.

=over 8

=item B<locate>

Turns Locate LED associated with the given device(s) or empty slot(s) on.

=item B<locate_off>

Only turns Locate LED off.

=item B<normal>

Turns Status LED, Failure LED and Locate LED off.

=item B<off>

Only turns Status LED and Failure LED off.

=item B<ica> or B<degraded>

Visualizes "In a Critical Array" pattern.

=item B<rebuild> or B<rebuild_p>

Visualizes "Rebuild" pattern.

=item B<ifa> or B<failed_array>

Visualizes "In a Failed Array" pattern.

=item B<hotspare>

Visualizes "Hotspare" pattern.

=item B<pfa>

Visualizes "Predicted Failure Analysis" pattern.

=item B<failure> or B<disk_failed>

Visualizes "Failure" pattern.

=back

=head2 List of Devices

The application accepts a list of devices in two formats. The first
format is a list with comma separated elements. The second format is S<a
list> in curly braces and elements are separated by space. See examples
section bellow for details.

A device is a path to file in /dev directory or in /sys/block directory.
It may identify a block device, a RAID device or a container device.
In case of RAID device or container device a state will be set for all
block devices associated, respectively.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-c> or B<--config>=I<path>

Sets a path to local configuration file. If this option is specified the
global configuration file and user configuration file has no effect.

=item B<-l> or B<--log>=I<path>

Sets a path to local log file. If this option is specified the global log
file F</var/log/ledctl.log> is not used.

=item B<--quiet>

Turns off all messages send to C<stdout> or C<stderr> out. The messages
will be still logged to local file and syslog facility.

=item B<-h> or B<--help>

Prints this text out and exits.

=item B<-v> or B<--version>

Displays version of ledctl and information about the license and exits.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over 8

=item F</var/log/ledctl.log>

Global log file, used by all instances of ledctl application. To force logging
to user defined file use I<-l> option switch.

=item F<~/.ledctl>

User configuration file, shared between ledmon and all ledctl application
instances.

=item F</etc/ledcfg.conf>

Global configuration file, shared between ledmon and all ledctl application
instances.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example illustrates how to locate a single block device.

    ledctl locate=/dev/sda

The following example illustrates how to off Locate LED for the same block
device.

    ledctl locate_off=/dev/sda

The following example illustrates how to locate disks of a RAID device and
how to set rebuild pattern for two block devices at the same time. This example
uses both formats of device list.

     ledctl locate=/dev/md127 rebuild={ /sys/block/sd[a-b] }

The following example illustrates how to off Status LED and Failure LED for
the given device(s).

     ledctl off={ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }

The following example illustrates how to locate a three block devices. This
example uses first format of device list.

     ledctl locate=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc
